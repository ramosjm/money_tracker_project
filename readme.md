Hello! Welcome to Lil' Bits.

My take on a spending tracker ruby app.

In order to run this you will need to create a database called 'tracker' and run the seeds.rb file located in the db directory.

That's all:

# Project - Web Programming with Ruby

Over the next week you will build an app to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

* Object oriented programming with Ruby
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Rules

The project must be built using only:

* HTML / CSS
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* PostgreSQL and the PG gem


## Briefs

These briefs detail what is expected of you, including an MVP. Note that the MVP is the **Minimum** Viable Product. You are strongly encouraged to go beyond these specifications, and some possible extensions are provided.

Talk through your ideas with an instructor during the planning process, and before you begin coding.

### Spending Tracker

Build an app that allows a user to track their spending.

#### MVP

* The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail
* The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport
* The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
* The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.
